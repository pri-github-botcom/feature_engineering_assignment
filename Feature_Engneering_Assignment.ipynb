        "In machine learning and deep learning, an optimizer is an algorithm used to adjust the parameter (weights and bases) of a model to minimizes the loss function during training. Optimizers guide the learning process by determining how the model's parameters should be updated based on the computed gradients from the loss function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Role of an Optimizer:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) Minimizes the error (loss).\n",

        "2) Speeds up convergence during training.\n",

        "The most basic optimization algorithm that minimizes the loss function by iteratively updating model parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n",

        "2) Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike gradient descent, which calculates the gradient over the entire dataset, SGD updates parameters using one data point (or a small batch) at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "* pros: Faster and more efficient for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Cons: Noisy updates can cause fluctuations during optimization.\n",

        "3) Mini-Batch Gradient Descent:\n",
        "\n",
        "A compromise between Gradient descent and SGD. It divides the dataset into small batches and updates the parameters using the gradient of each batch.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Momentum:\n",
        "\n",
        "Momentum builds upon SGD by adding a fraction of the previous update to current update, helping the optimizer move faster and avoid oscillations.\n",

        "5) Adagrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm):\n",
        "\n",
        "Adagrad adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on its updates. It works well for sparse data.\n",
